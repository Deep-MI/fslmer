## Overview

The `fslmer` package provides univariate and mass-univariate linear mixed-effects analysis for FreeSurfer imaging data. It is a port of Freesurfer's Matlab-based LME tools to the R programming language.

Please refer to the original documentation at https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/LongitudinalStatistics and https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/LinearMixedEffectsModels for an overview and further information about the software. For the original code, see the original repository at https://github.com/NeuroStats/lme.

## Installation

You can install fslmer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # use if needed
devtools::install_github("Deep-MI/fslmer")
```

## Running the program

There are two types of analyses that can be done: univariate and mass-univariate. The univariate analysis is, in principle, similar to classical mixed-effects analyses as implemented in the `lme4` or `nlme` packages. The mass-univariate analysis is specifically tailored for the surface-based vertex data from a preceding run of FreeSurfer's longitudinal analysis pipeline.

### Univariate analyses

- Loading the data

Usually you should already have a longitudinal Qdec table, which contains the subject IDs, image/observation/session IDs, time, and demographics (see https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/LongitudinalStatistics for a description of the format). Using Freesurfer's `asegstats2table` and/or `aparcstats2table` tools, you can extract the volume and/or thickness estimates from the longitudinally processed data in your subjects directory:

```
asegstats2table --qdec-long PATH_TO_QDEC_TABLE/qdec.table.dat -t PATH_TO_ANALYSIS_DIRECTORY/aseg.long.table
```

- Preparing the data

Your longitudinal Qdec table needs to contain the "fsid-base" (subject ID) columns and "fsid" (image/observation/session ID), and should contain an additional column indicating time from baseline or the sequence of observations. Additional columns such as diagnoses, demographics, or covariates may also be present. For the current example, we assume that the timing info is stored in a numerical variable called 'time', indicating years from baseline, and that a categorical variable 'DX' indicates a diagnosis at baseline. You can used other names and/or additional variables in your analysis, but the example code has to be adapted accordingly.

After loading the data, some further preparations are needed, including merging and sorting the data. In particular, the fslmer tools require the data ordered according to time for each individual (that is, your design matrix needs to have all the repeated assessments for the first subject, then all for the second and so on). 

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# Load aseg/aparc and qdec tables into R:
aseg <- read.table("PATH_TO_DATA/aseg.long.table", header=True)
qdec <- read.table("PATH_TO_QDEC_TABLE/qdec.table.dat", header=True )

# Read the qdec and aseg tables; note that R replaces '-' (and other characters) 
# in variable names with '.'.
qdec <- read.csv("adni-180-long-fs53-new.qdec")
aseg <- read.csv("adni-180-long-fs53-new-aseg.csv")

# For the aseg table, split the longitudinal ID into fsid and fsid.base.
aseg$fsid <- sub("\\.long\\..*", "", aseg$Measure.volume)
aseg$fsid.base <- sub(".*\\.long\\.", "", aseg$Measure.volume)

# Merge qdec and aseg tables based on fsid and fsid.base variables; create new 
# table 'dat'.
dat <- merge(qdec, aseg, by=c("fsid.base", "fsid"))

# Sort the by 'fsid.base' and then by 'time'. 
dat <- dat[order(dat$fsid.base, dat$Time.From.Baseline), ]

# Extract the structure of interest (here: volume of left hippocampus; can be 
# changed) and store it in a new variable 'Y'. The variable needs to be column 
# vector (hence the 'matrix' command).
Y <- matrix(dat$Left.Hippocampus, ncol=1)

# As an auxiliary variable, create a vector of number of observations per each 
# subject, i.e. count the number of occurances for each fsid.base. 
ni <- matrix(unname(table(dat$fsid.base)), ncol=1)
```

- Creating the design matrix and contrasts

Once you have your ordered data, you need to build your design matrix. As an example, a simple linear model containing a group by time interaction can be obtained with the following design matrix:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
X <- model.matrix(~time*DX, dat)
```

Let us assume that the categorical variable 'DX' has two levels, patients and controls. Then the model matrix 'X' will have four columns: one for the intercept, a time variable, a binary group indicator created from 'DX', and an interaction term between 'DX' and 'time'. The contrast `[0 0 0 1]`, which is a row vector with four elements, can then be used to test the interaction between `DX` and `time`, which indicates diverging slopes of thickness changes across time for the two groups. Instead of a contrast vector, it also possible to specify contrast matrices that have more than one row. Note that the number of columns of the contrast vector or matrix always needs to correspond to the number of columns in the model matrix.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
C <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 1), nrow=1)
```

- Estimating the model and conducting statistical inference

Estimate the model by using the `lme_fit_FS` function: The arguments `X`, `Y`, and `ni` have been defined before, and `Zcols` is a vector that indicates which terms of the model / columns of the design matrix should be regarded as random effects: assuming that the Intercept is the first column and time is the second column in `X`, use `Zcols=1` for a random-intercept model, and `Zcols=c(1, 2)` for a random-intercept-and-slope model.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
stats <- lme_fit_FS(X, Zcols, Y, ni)
```

The function returns a list representing a model fit, with entries Bhat, CovBhat and bihat, among others; Bhat contains the beta values, CovBhat is the error covariance matrix, and bihat the random-effects coefficients.

Finally, conduct an F-test using the `lme_F` function, which takes the model fit and the contrast vector / matrix as inputs:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
F_C <- lme_F(stats, C)
```

This will return a list with entries F, pval, sgn, and df: F is the F-value, pval is the p-value, sgn is the sign of the beta coefficient, and df are the degrees of freedom.

### Mass-univariate analyses

The mass-univariate analysis is run per hemisphere (lh and rh). Here and in the following, we only describe the analysis for the left hemisphere, which needs to done also for the right hemisphere.

Start with FreeSurfer's `mris_preproc` comamand, which uses the longitudinal 
qdec table to automatically find the longitudinally processed data and assembles 
it into a single lh.thickness.mgh file. Note that it is possible to use a 
different study template than the standard fsaverage template, and that other 
measures than thickness can be used as well (see the help for mris_preproc).

```
mris_preproc --qdec-long PATH_TO_QDEC_TABLE/qdec.table.dat --target fsaverage --hemi lh --meas thickness --out lh.thickness.mgh
```

The next step is to smooth the data; here we use a 10 mm FWHM kernel.

```
mri_surf2surf --hemi lh --s fsaverage --sval lh.thickness.mgh --tval lh.thickness_sm10.mgh --fwhm-trg 10 --cortex --noreshape
```

- Loading the data

The resulting file as well as will as a set of associated files will be read in to R

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# load the package
library(fslmer)

# read thickness file
lh.thickness<-lme_openmgh("/PATH/TO/lh.thickness_sm10.mgh")

# read template surface
lh.sphere<-lme_readsurf("/PATH/TO/FREESURFER/DIRECTORY/subjects/fsaverage/surf/lh.sphere")

# read cortical label file
lh.cortex<-lme_readlabel("/PATH/TO/FREESURFER/DIRECTORY/subjects/fsaverage/label/lh.cortex.label")[,1]
```

- Preparing the data

The design matrix is prepared in a similar way as for the univariate analysis. We just repeat the code here with minimal comments, see above for an explanation.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# read qdec table
dat <- read.csv("PATH_TO_QDEC_TABLE/qdec.table.dat")

# order qdec table based on fsid.base and time
dat <- dat[order(dat$fsid.base, dat$time), ]

# create vector of number of observations per subject
ni <- matrix(unname(table(dat$fsid.base)), ncol=1)

# create matrix from thickness data
Y <- t(drop(lh.thickness$x))

# create vector of cortical labels
maskvtx <- sort(lh.cortex)+1
```

- Creating the design matrix and contrasts

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# create model matrix
X <- model.matrix(~time*DX, dat)

# create contrasts
C1 <- matrix(c(0, 1, 0, 0), nrow=1)
C2 <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 1), nrow=1)
```

- Estimating the model and conducting statistical inference

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# obtain initial estimates
outFitInit <- lme_mass_fit_init(X=X, Zcols=1, Y=Y, ni=ni, maskvtx=maskvtx, numcore=12)

# run algorithm to identify spatially homogeneous regions
outRgGrow <- lme_mass_RgGrow(lh.sphere, outFitInit$Re0, outFitInit$Theta0, maskvtx=maskvtx, nst=2, prc=95)

# fit model
outFitRgw <- lme_mass_fit_Rgw(X, Zcols, Y, ni, outFitInit$Theta0, outRgGrow$Regions, lh.sphere, prs=12)

# inference
F_C1 <- lme_mass_F(outFitRgw$stats, C1)

# save
vol <- NULL
vol$ndim1 <- length(F_C1$F)
vol$ndim2 <- 1
vol$ndim3 <- 1
vol$nframes <- 1
vol$x <- F_C1$F
lme_savemgh(vol=vol, fname=OUTPUT_FILE_NAME)
```
